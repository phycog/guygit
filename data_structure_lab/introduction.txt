Python Specific Data Structures

1.List: It is similar to array with the exception that the data elements can be of different data types. You can have both numeric and string data in a python list.
2.Tuple: Tuples are similar to lists but they are immutable which means the values in a tuple cannot be modified they can only be read.
3.Dictionary: The dictionary contains Key-value pairs as its data elements.


General Data Structures 

Liner Data Structures

1.Array: It is a sequential arrangement of data elements paired with the index of the data element.
2.Linked List: Each data element contains a link to another element along with the data present in it.
3.Stack: It is a data structure which follows only to specific order of operation. LIFO(last in First Out) or FILO(First in Last Out).
4.Queue: It is similar to Stack but the order of operation is only FIFO(First In First Out).
5.Matrix: It is two dimensional data structure in which the data element is referred by a pair of indices.

Non-Liner Data Structures

1.Binary Tree: It is a data structure where each data element can be connected to maximum two other data elements and it starts with a root node.
2.Heap: It is a special case of Tree data structure where the data in the parent node is either strictly greater than/ equal to the child nodes or strictly less than itâ€™s child nodes.
3.Hash Table: It is a data structure which is made of arrays associated with each other using a hash function. It retrieves values using keys rather than index from a data element.
4.Graph: .It is an arrangement of vertices and nodes where some of the nodes are connected to each other through links.
5.Set : Mathematically a set is a collection of items not in any particular order. A Python set is similar to this mathematical definition with below additional conditions.
